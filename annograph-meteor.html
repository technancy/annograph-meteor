    When nonstate peoples (aka tribes) face pressures for political and social incorporation into a state system, a variety of responses is possible. They, or a section of them, may be incorporated loosely or tightly as a tributary society with a designated leader (indirect rule). They may, of course, fight to defend their autonomy - particularly if they are militarized pastoralists. They may move out of the way. Finally, they may, by fissioning, scattering and / changing their livelihood strategy, make themselves invisible or unattractive as objects of appropriation.
